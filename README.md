Create an AWS CodePipeline
In this step, we'll create an AWS CodePipeline to automate the continuous integration process for our Python application. AWS CodePipeline will orchestrate the flow of changes from our GitHub repository to the deployment of our application. Let's go ahead and set it up:
Setup Steps

Navigate to AWS CodePipeline

Go to the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS CodePipeline service
Click on the "Create pipeline" button


Configure Pipeline Settings

Provide a name for your pipeline
Click on the "Next" button


Configure Source Stage

For the source stage, select "GitHub" as the source provider
Connect your GitHub account to AWS CodePipeline and select your repository
Choose the branch you want to use for your pipeline


Configure Build Stage

In the build stage, select "AWS CodeBuild" as the build provider
Create a new CodeBuild project by clicking on the "Create project" button
Configure the CodeBuild project with the necessary settings for your Python application:

Build environment
Build commands
Artifacts


Save the CodeBuild project and go back to CodePipeline


Configure Deployment

Continue configuring the pipeline stages, such as deploying your application using AWS Elastic Beanstalk or any other suitable deployment option


Create Pipeline

Review the pipeline configuration
Click on the "Create pipeline" button to create your AWS CodePipeline
